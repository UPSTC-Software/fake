# Incident Commander

**[Run Incident Commander App][app]**

When an **Incident** is opened at [InVision App][invisionapp], one of the engineers has 
to run "point", acting as the liaison between the management / support teams and the 
engineers that are actively investigating the root cause. This point person is known as 
the "Incident Commander"; and, is responsible for communicating regular updates to one
of the company's Slack channels.

When I take on the role of Incident Commander, I like to use a specific format for my
Slack updates. If you've ever looked at my code, you know that I am very particular about
my formatting. These incident updates are no different. So, in order to make my life a 
little bit easier, I've put together a small Angular application that transforms incident 
updates into a tightly-formatted Slack message that I can quickly copy-and-paste into our
#Incident channel.
